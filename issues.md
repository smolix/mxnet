# MXNet Port Issues

Canonical work tracker for the fork. Episodic build session detail belongs in
git log, not here. Open / partial / deferred / external items are on top;
the **RESOLVED / HISTORICAL** section below the divider holds everything
already closed (kept for traceability and to avoid re-doing closed audits).

**Branch:** `cleanup/p0-p1-p2-20260522`
**Latest tag on GitHub:** `v2.0.0+cu13.bw.20260523.6` (release published with wheel)
**Local wheel:** `dist/mxnet-2.0.0+cu13.bw.20260523.7-*.whl` (USE_OPENCV=ON,
libopencv bundled at `python/mxnet/lib/`, RUNPATH `$ORIGIN/lib`, GPU OOM
retry path included, `lr_scheduler.epoch_size=` convenience, cuDNN autotune
defense-in-depth lock). **Two commits ahead of `origin/cleanup/...`** —
`399a081a4` (d2l Issues 1/3/5/6/7) and `9a5e60c8e` (d2l-mxnet-issues.md
PM snapshot) await a push (Yubikey ssh-agent not currently reachable).
**Validation host:** 4× RTX 4090 (sm_89), CUDA 13.0, cuDNN 9, NCCL
**macOS release tag:** `macos-arm64-slim-wheel-20260520`

Status labels:

- **Open** — known issue; no verified fix on the current branch.
- **In progress** — local work exists but is not committed and verified.
- **Partial** — first slice fixed; broader audit/coverage still pending.
- **Deferred** — cannot be verified here or out of scope for the current pass.
- **External** — owned by D2L, notebook infra, or another project.
- **Informational** — retained context, not a work item.

## Active Queue (Open / Partial / In-Progress)

| Priority | Tracker | Status | Issue | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | D2L-Issue-3 | Under investigation | `chapter_computer-vision/fine-tuning.ipynb` flaky DeadKernel on 4-GPU dispatch under `d2l.train_ch13`. NOT in autotune (also reproduces with autotune off). Single-GPU intermittently passes; synthetic 4-GPU 2-net repro is clean. Defense-in-depth `SelectPlan` mutex landed. | Reproduce outside `d2l.train_ch13` to isolate from the d2l notebook driver; suspect KVStore / parameter-broadcast / hybridize multi-GPU race. |
| P0 | FS12 | Deferred (architectural) | SIGBUS in `MXSetIsNumpyShape` thread_local ~21% through `test_numpy_op.py`; passes in isolation. Repro + ASAN runbook pinned in `tests/python/unittest/test_fs12_np_shape_bus_error_repro.py`. | Reopen when ASAN build is in the validation matrix. |
| P0 | B4 / XOP18 | Deferred (architectural) | Real `_backward_sg_onednn_*` for QAT needs an NNVM/CachedOp framework refactor (multi-week scope). 20-test coverage in `test_quantized_backward.py` (14 passed, 6 xfailed) is the truthful production state. | Reopen with a concrete framework-refactor proposal. |
| P1 | XOP9 | Partial | RNN dropout reserve-space req contract pinned (12 cases). Remaining: direct `out=` cuDNN / MKL Dropout forward path coverage. | Cover the backend-specific `out=` path; otherwise close. |
| P1 | XOP18 | Partial | Quantized self-attention subgraph forward contract pinned. Backward zero-grad behavior remains under B4. | Close alongside B4 framework refactor. |
| P1 | XOP23 | Partial | Engine assert→CHECK conversions + 3 race-stress tests landed. Remaining: NCCL root/device mismatch stress (needs `USE_NCCL=ON` build). | Cover NCCL stress once `USE_NCCL=ON` build is in the validation matrix. |
| P1 | XOP26 | Partial | WarpCTC kNullOp/kAddTo gate + OpenCV plugin buffer-bytes fix landed; OpenCV plugin tests pass. WarpCTC sentinel test skips unless plugin is built. | Re-run WarpCTC sentinel test in a WarpCTC-enabled build. |
| P1 | FS8 | In progress | Repaired profiler/NCCL/KVStore stale-skip batch passes `6 passed, 1 skipped`; old Gluon issue-11164 dynamic reshape/slice tests reactivated in focused group `19 passed`; higher-order grad + quantization GPU at `51 passed, 6 skipped`. | Keep stale skips under suspicion; either repair, capability-gate, or open a concrete bug row. |
| P1 | FS13 | Partial | Lint piece in place (`test_fs13_skip_reason_tracker_id.py`) — every `pytest.mark.skip*/xfail` reason must name a tracker, GitHub ref, or recognized capability/structural gate. | Walk the current skip list and either repair, capability-gate, or document each. |
| P2 | CN9 / L6 | Open (track upstream) | Bundled dmlc concurrent queue still assigns `-1` into a `uint32_t` sentinel under NVCC; oneDNN's vendored ITT assembly still lacks a non-executable-stack note. | Do not commit private submodule-local fixes; track as upstream/submodule policy. |
| P2 | C4 | Open | CUDA build matrix CI for Ada/Hopper/Blackwell + CUDA 12.x compatibility. | Validate `sm_89` here; leave CUDA 12.x and dedicated Blackwell to later runners. |
| P2 | L7 | In progress | Target load envelope: 48-64 runnable tasks; cap `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2-4`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS=1` for xdist lanes. | Keep one heavy CPU lane at a time. |
| P2 | O1, O4, O7 | Open | Linux wheel doesn't bundle CUDA/cuDNN/NCCL runtimes (O1); GitHub Release automation absent (O4); no conda/system package story (O7). | Strategic; revisit when needed. |
| P2 | O11 | In progress | Wheel version stamping via `MXNET_PACKAGE_VERSION` works through primary and legacy setup paths; release-wheel workflow validates PEP 440. Local artifacts predate the fix. | Rebuild artifacts with source-specific local version in a controlled environment, then re-validate provenance. |
| P2 | T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T11 | Open / Partial | T2 GluonNLP/Sockeye/AutoGluon (DGL out of scope); T3 multi-machine ps-lite rendezvous; T4 Python 3.13+; T5 NumPy 2.x ABI; T6 DLPack PyTorch/JAX/CUDA interop; T11 cross-platform lifecycle coverage. | Strategic; revisit when needed. |
| Strategic | O8, O9, O12 | Informational / Deferred | Apache MXNet archived 2023-11-17 — all fixes live in this fork (O8). Future oneDNN major releases will require porting (O9). ONNX Runtime 1.26 / opset 26 refresh is out of scope for current Linux/CUDA cleanup (O12). | — |
| Strategic | P1, P3, P4, P5 | Deferred / Hardware | cuBLASLt default-on / stride-aware / INT8 (P1); topk K-independence (P3); softmax / LayerNorm small-op kernel pipelines (P4); BF16 CPU validation on AVX-512-BF16 hardware (P5). | Defer; benchmark harness driven. |
| Deferred | GH7, GH8, GH9 | Deferred | Horovod KVStore barrier API (GH7); FlexiBLAS / THP / `parallel_for` grain (GH8); TensorRT upgrade (GH9). | Out of scope until specific drivers exist. |
| External | L4, D5, D6, D7, D8 | External | Wait for fresh d2l notebook-run / output-audit artifacts. D5 dead-kernel batch (BERT NLI closed via D2L-Bug-3); D6 stamp/output mismatch; D7 import-time GPU probing; D8 artifact quality signal. | Wait for fresh artifacts. |
| Remote | FP16 smoke | Remote | `tools/run_fp16_remote_smoke.sh` ready for a Zen 4+ host. | Run on target when available. |

### Cross-Platform Lifecycle Coverage TODO (T11)

- [ ] Linux x86 CPU: DataLoader, ThreadedEngine, KVStore, custom-op lifecycle tests with and without oneDNN.
- [ ] Linux CUDA: CUDA analogues for engine exception propagation, KVStore lifetime, custom-op forward/backward failure isolation.
- [ ] Linux CUDA: re-run lifecycle tests against `NaiveEngine`, `ThreadedEnginePooled`, `ThreadedEnginePerDevice`.
- [ ] Sanitizers: C++ engine/OpenMP/KVStore subset under TSAN; C++/Python lifecycle subset under ASAN/UBSAN.
- [ ] CI: add a quick job that builds `mxnet_unit_tests` and runs the focused lifecycle filters before any expensive full-suite job.

## D2L Diagnostics — External Wait State

These items were imported from the prior d2l diagnostics reports and logs. They
were observed with MXNet `2.0.0+cu13.bw.20260517` before the Apple Silicon merge
and before an Ada-specific rebuild. Current triage treats D1 as resolved
(OpenCV wheel-dependency bug), D2/D3/D4 as resolved (CUDA arch / scalar /
transformer batch-dot), and D5-D8 as external D2L notebook infrastructure
ownership unless a standalone MXNet crash repro appears.

| ID | Issue | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| D5 | `transformer.ipynb`, `natural-language-inference-bert.ipynb`, `sentiment-analysis-rnn.ipynb` ended as `DeadKernelError` in old diagnostics. BERT NLI verified alive on `.20260523.5` (cell timeout, not dead kernel — see D2L-Bug-3 in appendix). | Wait for fresh notebook-run artifacts; reopen only if a current runtime failure reproduces outside notebook infrastructure. |
| D6 | `chapter_builders-guide/use-gpu.ipynb` had a passing stamp while stored outputs still contained GPU errors. | External D2L output-audit; reopen on fresh MXNet runtime failure. |
| D7 | In restricted environments, `d2l.mxnet` queries GPUs at import time through default arguments such as `devices=d2l.try_all_gpus()`. | d2l-side lazy-default fix; not an MXNet runtime bug. |
| D8 | Completed MXNet notebooks mostly had sane outputs; main issue was missing GPU runtime coverage, not bad convergence. | Artifact quality signal, not an MXNet defect. |

# RESOLVED / HISTORICAL

Everything below this divider is closed work or historical record. Rows are
kept for traceability and to avoid re-doing closed audits.

## Resolved In Current Cleanup Branch (`cleanup/p0-p1-p2-20260522`)

Compact summary; commit hashes, test paths, and detail-level reasoning live in
git log. Latest entries at the top.

| Date | Tracker | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-23 PM | **D2L-Issue-6** lr-scheduler step semantics | Measurement (`tests/python/unittest/test_d2l_lr_scheduler_epoch_size.py`) confirmed MXNet `MultiFactorScheduler` / `CosineScheduler`, PyTorch `MultiStepLR`, and `optax.piecewise_constant_schedule` are semantically equivalent — all count caller-supplied steps; none has an intrinsic epoch concept. The d2l-mxnet 2× train-loss gap is from `Trainer.step()` advancing per-minibatch while the d2l notebook passes epoch-scale milestones. Added `epoch_size=` kwarg to `FactorScheduler` / `MultiFactorScheduler` / `PolyScheduler` / `CosineScheduler` so callers can pass epoch indices and get PyTorch-equivalent decay. 10 regression tests. **D2L-side notebook fix outstanding** — note delivered to `~/d2l-neu/MXNET-FIXES-ISSUES-6-AND-7.md`. Commit `399a081a4`. |
| 2026-05-23 PM | **D2L-Issue-7** FCN reduction gap | Measurement confirmed `gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss(axis=1)`, `F.cross_entropy`, and `optax.softmax_cross_entropy_with_integer_labels` produce **bit-identical** mean loss on FCN-shaped inputs. The real cause of the 3× higher d2l-mxnet train loss is `gluon.Trainer.step(N)` rescaling gradient by `1/N` while PyTorch's `optimizer.step()` does not — for `lr=0.001, batch_size=32`, MXNet's effective LR is 32× smaller. `Trainer.step()` docstring updated with explicit PyTorch comparison. 3 regression tests in `test_d2l_trainer_rescale_semantics.py`. **D2L-side notebook fix outstanding** — note delivered to `~/d2l-neu/MXNET-FIXES-ISSUES-6-AND-7.md` (Option A: `trainer.step(1)` global; Option B: bump FCN lr to `0.032`). Commit `399a081a4`. |
| 2026-05-23 PM | **D2L-Issue-5** storage banner suppression | Banner gating (already in place at `src/storage/storage.cc:201-209` behind `MXNET_LOG_STORAGE_INIT=1`) pinned by `test_d2l_storage_banner_suppression.py` (2 tests: silent by default, visible on opt-in). Commit `399a081a4`. |
| 2026-05-23 PM | **D2L-Issue-1** argmax regression (legacy nd.) | Extended `test_d2l_argmax_size_one_axis_regression.py` with 6 additional cases covering legacy `mx.nd.argmax` / `mx.nd.argmin` on size-1 GPU axes (the original report flagged checking whether legacy API shares the broken kernel; it does, and is also fixed by the `reduce_kernel_M1` shadow). 19 tests total, all green. Commit `399a081a4`. |
| 2026-05-23 PM | **D2L-Issue-3** fine-tuning DeadKernel triage | Empirically confirmed NOT in autotune — same flaky DeadKernel reproduces under `MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE_DEFAULT=0` and under `MXNET_CUDNN_FORCE_NO_HEURISTIC_PLANS=1`. Single-GPU runs intermittently pass; multi-GPU is the flaky path. Synthetic two-net repro on 4 GPUs runs clean. Added defense-in-depth `std::mutex` around `SelectPlan` in `src/operator/cudnn_ops.cc` (disable via `MXNET_CUDNN_AUTOTUNE_SERIALIZE=0`). Root cause of the d2l-notebook-only multi-GPU crash still under investigation — likely in `d2l.train_ch13` / KVStore interaction, not in MXNet itself. Commit `399a081a4`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **FS3 / FS5** | Sweeps green. Focused C++ sweep (`Engine.*:CAPI*.*:ThreadLocal.*:OMPBehaviour.*:EngineShutdown.*`) **21/21 passed**. GPU shard (8 files: batchnorm-running-stats, deconv-TF32, device-pushpull, fork-safe-dnnl, pool-dynamic-shape, reducer-regressions, d2l-bug-2, d2l-argmax) **51 passed** in 34.6s. Commit `175e3ed7b`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **D2L-Bug-3** (BERT NLI dead kernel) | Closed by the D2L-Bug-2 retry path. Solo BERT NLI on `.20260523.5` survived past the original 1095s death point and ran for 1400s before hitting the cell timeout (`CellTimeoutError`, kernel alive). The original symptom was an OOM `LOG(FATAL)` from an engine worker (which exits via `abort()` without traceback). Commit `0f52a3d18`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **D2L-Bug-2** (GPU OOM) | Bounded retry-with-backoff in `PooledStorageManager::Alloc` for `cudaErrorMemoryAllocation`. Default 4 retries × 50/100/200/400 ms (≤750 ms wall before FATAL), gated by `MXNET_GPU_MEM_POOL_OOM_{RETRIES,BACKOFF_MS}`. FATAL diagnostic now includes requested bytes / pool used / device free/total / retries. Coverage in `tests/python/gpu/test_d2l_bug_2_gpu_oom_retry.py` (8 tests, incl. 4 GB × 2-process concurrent smoke). Commit `1e5cb5019`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **XOP12 expansion** | Aux-state + inplace dimensions added to the contract harness. BatchNorm inference-mode aux-state preservation, BatchNorm training-mode aux-state update, Activation kWriteInplace-chain correctness. 51 contract checks + 3 new dimensions. Commit `0f52a3d18`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **XOP19** primary outputs | Audit-closed. Cached `dnnl::memory` + `set_data_handle` is functionally equivalent to `CreateDNNLMem + CommitOutput` for the supported reqs (`kWriteTo`, `kWriteInplace`) without the per-call alloc/copy overhead. `kNullOp` early-returns; `kAddTo` is `CHECK_NE`'d. Float-accumulate would be wrong for quantized output anyway. |
| 2026-05-23 | **XOP22 tail** | Two user-facing asserts in `mxnet.symbol.contrib` (foreach body format mismatch; while_loop cond shape) converted to `raise ValueError`. Internal-invariant asserts annotated as `# mxnet invariant, not user-facing`. Coverage in `test_xop22_symbol_contrib_user_validation.py` (4 tests). Commit `6a3ab8138`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **GH1 tail** | NDK r19c Dockerfile SHA256 pin via `sha256sum -c`; ARMv6 toolchain Dockerfile gets `--fail --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2` + `ARMV6_TOOLCHAIN_SHA256` build arg; `get-pip.py` wget enforces TLSv1.2 + retries + size check; `deploy.sh` defensive wget + cleanup-on-failure; `link_check.yml`, `os_x_mklbuild.yml`, `os_x_staticbuild.yml` bumped to `actions/checkout@v4` + `setup-python@v5`; `tools/diagnose.py` bounds DNS resolve via `socket.setdefaulttimeout` save/restore. Coverage in `test_gh1_dockerfile_and_workflow_hardening.py` (6 tests). Commit `6a3ab8138`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **GH2** | Audit-closed. Independent scan of `src/c_api/`, `include/mxnet/c_api.h`, `cpp-package/include/mxnet-cpp/` confirms no remaining concrete C/C++ API parity gaps. cpp-package stubs (`Reshape`, optimizer, `FeedForward`) are feature-work, not API parity. |
| 2026-05-23 | **GH6 tail** | `ImageListDataset` skips blank lines (was crashing on `int("")`); uses int keys for both file-loaded and list-loaded variants (was str on list path → two keyspaces); `MNIST` raises `ValueError` on empty/truncated label files. Coverage in `test_gh6_dataset_edge_cases.py` (3 tests). Commit `0f52a3d18`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **FS12** | Diagnostic anchor + ASAN runbook pinned in `test_fs12_np_shape_bus_error_repro.py`. Bisected to `test_np_sum[False-int64-int64-int64-False-1-shape1]` SIGBUS in `MXSetIsNumpyShape` thread_local at ~21% through file; passes in isolation. Root-cause still requires ASAN. Commit `0f52a3d18`. |
| 2026-05-23 | **XOP19** quantized FC primary output | `quantized_fully_connected.cu` rejects `kAddTo` before write (cuBLAS GEMM had hardcoded `beta=0`). Commit `032fcea0d` and earlier. |
| 2026-05-23 | **XOP19** selfatt gates | `SgDNNLSelfAttQKForward` + `DNNLSelfAttValAttForward` kNullOp early-return + kAddTo CHECK_NE; source-grep regression in `test_xop18_quantized_subgraph_req.py`. Commit `032fcea0d`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP21** large-shape truncation | GroupNorm `N`, ROIAlign / PSROIPool count-launch counters, BilinearSampler / SpatialTransformer block counts, dnnl_dot bigDim products, multi_sum_sq chunks-per-tensor all INT_MAX-guarded. Tests in `test_xop21_large_shape_validation.py`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP22** second wave | Gluon Parameter / KVStore base / BytePS asserts raise. Vocab/embedding/contrib.quantization/symbol.contrib `_flatten`/`_regroup`/`check_input` converted. `python -O` subprocess suite at 39 passed (was 19). |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP23** engine invariants | Assert→CHECK conversions in `threaded_engine.cc`. `Engine.WriteAfterReadChainTermination`, `Engine.RapidVarAllocDelete`, `Engine.ShutdownRaceCreateUseDeleteCycle` in `threaded_engine_invariants_test.cc` (8 threads × 256 cycles). |
| 2026-05-22 | **CN2 / CN9** policy | `RelWithDebInfo` retains `-Wno-error=array-bounds` / `-Wno-error=stringop-overflow` for GCC ≥ 13 with documenting comment. CN9 dmlc queue u32 sentinel + oneDNN ITT executable-stack are documented as upstream/submodule policy in `BUILDING.md`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **CL-11 / GH1** legacy shell | `tools/dependencies/make_shared_dependencies.sh` carries a deprecation header pointing at `tools/build_cleanup_wheel.sh` as the current build path; SHA256 policy documented. |
| 2026-05-22 | **D2L-Bug-1** argmax GPU size-1 | `reduce_kernel_M1` in `src/operator/tensor/reduce_rtc.cc` used the outer flat-output index as the `index` referenced by `FUNC = AType(OP(...), index)`. Block-scope `const index_t index = 0;` shadow fix. 13 tests in `test_d2l_argmax_size_one_axis_regression.py`. Commit `cb2cdff7a`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **D2L-Bug-4** stale `mxnet.__version__` | `setup.py` writes `mxnet/_build_info.py` from resolved `MXNET_PACKAGE_VERSION`; `libinfo.py` imports from it. Commit `667498cb8`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **D2L-Bug-5** storage banner | Banner gated behind `MXNET_LOG_STORAGE_INIT=1`. Commit `667498cb8`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **BoxNMS** add segfault | `_backward_contrib_box_nms` declares `FResourceRequest{kTempSpace}` so `kAddTo` branch doesn't dereference past empty resource vector. Commit `667498cb8`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP7** DNNL deconv weight-grad | `CreateDNNLWeightGrad` handles `kNullOp`; `DNNLDeconvBwd::WeightsGradMem`'s kWriteTo fast path nullptr-checks `CreateDNNLData` with helper fallback. Tests in `test_xop7_dnnl_deconv_req.py`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP8** quantized range outputs | All quantized reshape/quantize/quantize_v2 + DNNL variants + dnnl_fc + `_contrib_quantized_embedding` route through `AssignQuantizedRangeOutput`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP14** cuBLAS req→beta | cuDNN activation/pooling/softmax/LRN/bilinear/spatial-transformer wrappers + LRN backward honor kNullOp/kAddTo; 11 direct-cuBLAS sites audited; `quantized_fully_connected.cu` gated. Commit `a77daea17`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP16** quantized embedding | Storage contract pinned (shape+dtype+range-output value) in `test_xop16_quantized_embedding_storage.py`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **XOP19** MaskedSoftmax | `DNNLMaskedSoftmaxForward` early-returns on kNullOp + `CHECK_NE`s kAddTo; pinned by `test_xop19_masked_softmax_req.py`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **FS3** image_random_crop | kAddTo rejection unconditional (was only on resize path). Commit `f5e1aa7dd`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **D2L-1 / D2L-3 / D2L-4** oneDNN 0-dim | `LOG(FATAL)` on 0-dim/view-path/GetDefaultFormat/GetPermutedFormat all fixed; 5+2 tests in `test_d2l_zero_dim_dnnl_regression.py`. Cleared 24 d2l notebook failures. |
| 2026-05-22 | **D2L-2** OpenCV bundling | `USE_OPENCV=ON` build bundles `libopencv_*.so.4.6.0` at `python/mxnet/lib/` with RUNPATH `$ORIGIN/lib`; `opencv-python>=4,<5` declared in setup metadata. 4 tests in `test_d2l_opencv_image_io_regression.py`. |
| 2026-05-22 | **D2L-5** batch_dot underflow | Defense-in-depth: 0-dim batch_dot raises early instead of falling into a 0-dim DNNL primitive. |
| 2026-05-22 | **GH4** trailing leak | `base.py` operator-module signature generation wraps both `get_module_file()` opens in the same try/finally; `tools/rec2idx.py` closes index file via try/finally. |
| 2026-05-22 | **P2** Blackwell wheel | sm_80/86/89/90/100/120 SASS + compute_120 PTX wheel built (`v2.0.0+cu13.bw.20260522.1`); guard test `test_cuda_arch_policy.py`. |

## Cross-Operator Audit (XOP1-XOP27) — Resolved

All cross-operator audit rows are closed. Detailed per-row resolutions remain
in the appendix below for traceability.

| ID | Area | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| XOP1 | Norm state semantics | Native CUDA BN with `cudnn_off=True` + SyncBN update moving mean/var in forward, not backward. |
| XOP2 | Norm affine semantics | BN / SyncBN no longer mutate gamma for `fix_gamma=True`; native CUDA, cuDNN, SyncBN paths preserve `grad_req` semantics. |
| XOP3 | oneDNN LayerNorm | Publishes `std = sqrt(var + eps)`; backward converts back to oneDNN variance; gamma/beta `grad_req='add'` accumulation. |
| XOP4 | fp16 reductions | CUDA non-last-axis LayerNorm / GroupNorm keep fp16 forward mean/std/scratch in fp32 until final cast. |
| XOP5 | Shape inference | GroupNorm/InstanceNorm/SyncBN reject caller-provided bad gamma/beta shapes via checked shape assignment. |
| XOP6 | Hidden-output metadata | InstanceNorm hidden mean/var canonical names; CTCLoss `FListOutputNames` spelling fixed. |
| XOP7 | oneDNN output req/copyback | LayerNorm, deconv weight-grad fast path, softmax/log-softmax fwd+bwd, activation fwd+bwd, batch_norm fwd, quantized batch_norm, masked_softmax — audit complete via `CreateDNNLMem` / `CommitOutput` or explicit gates. |
| XOP8 | Quantized range outputs | All native + oneDNN quantized variants route range outputs through `AssignQuantizedRangeOutput`. |
| XOP9 | Stochastic / resource ops | Dropout backward + MKL/cuDNN paths; RNN dropout reserve-space contract (12 cases). (Backend-specific Dropout `out=` direct path open — see active queue.) |
| XOP10 | Aux-state timing | `IdentityAttachKLSparseReg` updates moving averages in forward, uses output request for forward assignment. |
| XOP11 | Gluon affine flags | `LayerNorm(center=False/scale=False)` substitutes zero beta and one gamma. |
| XOP12 | Contract harness | 51 contract checks + aux-state (BN) + inplace (Activation) dimensions. |
| XOP13 | General output-request semantics | Resize / random-crop / crop-resize, TopK mask, native LRN backward, `_npi_average(returned=True)`, BoxNMS, `_npi_unique`, `sample_unique_zipfian`, empty-input NumPy reductions — all gated. |
| XOP14 | cuDNN/library beta mapping | cuDNN wrappers + 11 direct-cuBLAS sites + `quantized_fully_connected.cu` honor kNullOp/kAddTo. |
| XOP15 | Quantized primary-output req | `_contrib_quantized_elemwise_mul`, native + oneDNN quantize/quantize_v2/dequantize honor kNullOp/kAddTo for primary, shared helpers for ranges. |
| XOP16 | Quantized inference contracts | Quantized embedding storage contract (shape+dtype+range value) pinned. |
| XOP17 | Quantized metadata | Quantized RNN lists `statecell_output` when `state_outputs=True`. |
| XOP18 | Quantized subgraph forward | Forward contract anchor (registration + shape) for `_sg_onednn_selfatt_qk{,_split,_valatt}`. (Backward remains under B4.) |
| XOP19 | oneDNN descriptor/output handling | Reducer, softmax, batch-dot, deconv weight-grad, dnnl_reshape, `DNNLMaskedSoftmax`, BF16 fallback paths in selfatt + conv all converted or gated. Primary writes in quantized subgraphs use cached dst pattern (audit-closed). |
| XOP20 | Image dtype validation | `resize-inl.h` int32/int64 guard fixed; image resize preserves `kNullOp` and rejects `kAddTo`. |
| XOP21 | Large-tensor size truncation | LayerNorm, GroupNorm, ROIAlign, PSROIPool, BilinearSampler, SpatialTransformer, dnnl_dot, multi_sum_sq all INT_MAX-guarded. |
| XOP22 | Python validation via assert | AMP, KVStore, RecordIO, RTC, schedulers, Gluon Parameter, optimizers, contrib text/vocab/embedding/quantization, symbol/ndarray contrib, foreach/while_loop user input → `raise ValueError`. `python -O` suite at 39 passed. |
| XOP23 | Engine/runtime invariant | Assert→CHECK conversions + 3 race-stress tests. (NCCL stress open — see active queue.) |
| XOP24 | CUDA/NCCL unchecked status | `cudaMemcpyPeerAsync` checked; KVStore P2P / `KVStoreNCCL` NCCL/init calls checked; healthy-path P2P coverage. |
| XOP25 | Storage/profiler UB | `SET_GPU_PROFILER` null-checks profiler ptr; Linux CPU memory info multiplies by `mem_unit`. |
| XOP26 | Plugin/output contracts | WarpCTC kNullOp/kAddTo gate; OpenCV plugin buffer-bytes fix. (WarpCTC sentinel test skips unless plugin built — see active queue.) |
| XOP27 | Visualization metadata | `plot_network()` forms shape/type keys from consumed output index. |

## Compiler Noise Triage — Resolved

All CN clusters closed except CN9 (submodule boundary, in active queue).

- **CN1** Build throughput — non-tuning builds skip `operator_tune.cc`.
- **CN2** Tuple/runtime allocation — overflow guards + `-Wno-error=array-bounds`/`-Wno-error=stringop-overflow` for GCC ≥ 13.
- **CN3** dmlc optional — fixed in dmlc-core commit `d610d79`.
- **CN4** Half/bfloat reductions — residual initialization independent of reducer setup.
- **CN5** CUDA unsigned guards — bincount/delete/nan-to-num/np_random with type-trait guards.
- **CN6** Sentinel conversions — `np_cross` / `np_matmul` value-initialize vectors.
- **CN7** Half param packing — fused optimizers use typed assignment instead of `memcpy`.
- **CN8** Local cleanup — CUDA resize/transformer unused vars, KVStore NCCL overload noise, pointwise fusion init, CTC moderngpu, mshadow packet alloc, einsum init, half max-pool init.

## D2L Diagnostics Import — Resolved

- **D1** Runtime deps (OpenCV) — release-wheel workflow configures `-DUSE_OPENCV=OFF` by default; primary metadata/runtime-bundling guard committed; `MXNET_SETUP_ENABLE_OPENCV_DEPS=0` opt-out; legacy `tools/pip/setup.py` CD path bundles `libopencv_*` when enabled. Current `.20260523.5` wheel uses `USE_OPENCV=ON` with bundled libs and RUNPATH.
- **D2** CUDA arch coverage — `sm_89` rebuild clears the no-kernel-image gate on Ada host. Release matrix coverage tracked under O2/C4.
- **D3** GPU scalar host sync — standalone scalar-to-host probes OK on rebuilt binary.
- **D4** Transformer native crash — oneDNN `batch_dot` reorders MXNet buffers into primitive-selected descriptors; `_sg_onednn_batch_dot` adds temp-space request. Coverage in `test_batch_dot_attention_regression.py`.

## Linux/CUDA Execution Queue — Resolved

- **L0** Build setup; **L1** Apple fixes on x86 (DataLoader, DLPack, quantization, oneDNN, NumPy drift); **L2** CUDA smoke; **L3** CUDA regression batch (cuDNN/TF32/cuBLASLt/fp16/linalg/deferred-compute/reducer/NumPy/sparse/KVStore/NCCL/histogram/Proposal); **L5** Tracker cleanup; **L8** Build freshness; **L9** Host GPU driver state (NVIDIA 580.126.20 → 580.159.03 after reboot).

## Linux/CUDA Validation Backlog — Resolved

## Blackwell / CUDA Correctness Backlog — Resolved

- **B1** oneDNN INT8 subgraphs — `test_matmul_subgraph.py` 64 passed; **B2** Quantized Gluon — `test_quantization_dnnl.py` 26 passed; **B3** Mixed dtype quantization — AMP treats quantize_v2/dequantize as FP32 boundary; **B5** Mixed dtype matrix — `test_mixed_dtype_matrix.py` 5 passed.

## Full-Sweep Findings — Resolved

- **FS1** CPU unittest (1752 passed); **FS2** oneDNN Python (DNNL 30 / subgraphs 935 / quantization 26+26); **FS4** NCCL bandwidth (metric, not assertion); **FS6** GPU operator (3131 + 1905 NumPy + classic shards); **FS7** DNNL quantized conv+sum (4 focused checks); **FS9** Gluon BatchNorm crash (local-stats training routed to native CPU); **FS10** Higher-order gradients (test-source `variables=x` misuse); **FS11** Quantization GPU wrapper.

## GitHub Delta — Resolved

- **GH1** Security/tooling (zip extraction, ipynb2md subprocess, kill-mxnet, build_openmp, SHA256 pins, OpenCV downloader, ci.util.download_file, EC2 metadata, S3 key normalization, NDK + ARMv6 + get-pip + deploy.sh, 3 stale workflow versions, diagnose.py DNS).
- **GH2** C/C++ inference API parity (CppExecutor grad alignment, autograd-correct inference rerun, `MXSymbolGetInputSymbols` `ListInputs(kAll)`, `CutGraphInputs` + `MXSymbolGetChildren` NodeEntry dedup, `MXInvokeCachedOp` thread-safe).
- **GH3** Autograd/Gluon semantics (`autograd.grad` shape, attach_grad add, Gluon export dtype).
- **GH4** Resource hygiene (RecordIO, logger lifetime, base.py first/second-file leak, rec2idx).
- **GH5** Operator correctness (argsort fp16, linspace int floor, RReLU mask, NumPy min/max infinity, ModulatedDeformableConvolution slice, Gluon GroupNorm disabled affine).
- **GH6** Dataset/transforms (RecordFileDataset reader reset, ImageFolderDataset classes=, image-path separator, MultiBoxPrior coverage, RandomRotation skip-path labels, ImageListDataset blank-line + key-type, MNIST empty-label).

## Apple Silicon / macOS Wheel — Resolved

- **A6** Resource shutdown; **A7** macOS multiprocessing (`cpu_shared` probe + pickle-transport fallback); **A8** macOS slim optimized wheel built.

| Quantize asym | oneDNN v3 attr-on-reorder issue fixed with `set_scales_mask(DNNL_ARG_DST, 0)`. |
| INT8 conv concat/relu/u8 | Runtime + property gates avoid the oneDNN small-channel u8 post-op bug. |
| Softrelu backward | `test_activation` softrelu resolved and unskipped. |
| Random seeding | CPU random generators are per logical CPU dev_id, matching GPU. |

| CUDA linalg temp storage | Ephemeral GPU scratch synchronizes before free. |
| AMP subgraph | BF16-on-AVX2 fallback upcasts to fp32 for unsupported oneDNN primitives. |
| AMP RNN conversion | Repaired; original cuDNN 9 waitall failure did not reproduce. |
| NCCL single-process | 2-GPU NCCL KVStore tests passed; multi-process DDP-style is outside MXNet KVStore design. |
| Test-source bugs | Several stale numpy/op tests fixed or correctly skipped. |
| GPU profiler symbolic test | oneDNN v3 node-name expectation updated. |
| ONNX | Opset 18 reduction API change handled; broader ORT 1.26 / ONNX 1.21 refresh deferred under O12. |
| cuDNN 9.22 bump | Depthwise conv perf improved on Blackwell. |
| cuDNN frontend autotune | Env-gated v9 frontend autotune path added; default conservative. |

| Sparse ops | CUDA 13 / Thrust 3 sparse benchmarks: no port regression. |
| fp16 tensor cores | Large dense/conv fp16 near PyTorch parity on Blackwell. |
